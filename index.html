<h1><u>Walk the Width</u></h1>
<p>Hi! We're a group of sixth formers from Hills Road raising money for <a href="https://www.romseymill.org/">Romsey Mill</a>, a charity that supports disadvantaged young people accross Cambridge.<br><br>
We will do this by (as a group) walking the width of the United Kingdom (as a group).<br><br>
You can donate money on our <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/walk-the-width-1717411522624">Just Giving Page</a>.</p>
